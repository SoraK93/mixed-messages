# Project: Mixed Messages

This project simulates fortune cookie like messages. It selects a random zodiac sign, guesses how lucky user is today and gives a silly advice.

The code uses a object to store all the data, and uses `Math.random()` for all the random selection. Later it using string interpolation to print out all the randomly selected output.
